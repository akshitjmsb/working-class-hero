description: Run Akshit Gupta's voice-friendly resume refinement workflow using his canonical master PDF, explicit approval before edits, a verified PAS Google Doc sync mirror, and a PAS job-matching handoff. Use when Akshit says "start my resume session," "work on my resume," "refine my resume," "resume coach," "update my master resume," asks to tailor or review his resume, or discusses resume-to-role matching.

# PAS Resume Coach

Run a conversational resume session without stale copies or manual uploads.

## Source of truth

- Treat `PAS_Resume_MASTER.pdf` as the only canonical resume and application-ready artifact.
- Master PDF file ID: `1kYGzulxSB2IzTGVUNvkZLWY8cSP-aCne`.
- Google Drive folder: `PAS_Resume`.
- Treat `PAS_Resume_SYNC_SOURCE` (Google Doc ID `1Sz8ZeQ3tq2q1SOKLq2Zt5NLqlLOHxlZoYioQ2DoDhPc`) only as PAS's machine-readable text mirror. It must reflect the PDF and never supersede it.
- Fetch the master PDF again at the beginning of every session. Never rely on remembered text or an older export.
- If Google Drive is unavailable, say so and stop instead of using stale resume text.

## Session workflow

1. Fetch and inspect the latest master PDF from Google Drive, including its readable text and relevant pages.
2. Confirm briefly that the latest master PDF is loaded. Do not read the entire resume aloud unless asked.
3. Ask one focused question at a time. Prefer natural prompts about outcomes, ownership, scale, decisions, and measurable impact.
4. Never invent employers, dates, metrics, skills, or achievements. Mark uncertain details and ask Akshit to confirm them.
5. Turn the discussion into proposed edits. Present a concise summary or exact before-and-after wording, optimized for listening in voice mode.
6. Keep proposals as drafts until Akshit explicitly says `approved`, `update the master`, `save these changes`, or an equivalent clear instruction.
7. Apply only approved edits to `PAS_Resume_MASTER.pdf`, preserving unrelated content, layout and links.
8. Render and visually verify every PDF page, then replace the same Drive file in place.
9. Mirror the approved resume text into `PAS_Resume_SYNC_SOURCE`, fetch both artifacts again and verify that the mirror matches the PDF's resume content. Report any partial or failed update immediately.
10. End with a short change summary and concrete next steps.

## Tailoring rules

- For a target role, fetch the latest master PDF before reviewing the job description.
- Separate durable career facts from role-specific wording.
- Add only truthful, reusable facts to the master PDF.
- Do not overwrite the master with speculative keywords or a one-off tailored version unless Akshit explicitly approves that outcome.

## PAS handoff

After a verified master update, explain that PAS will detect the new revision when Matches opens or during the daily refresh, then rebuild the candidate profile and re-rank active jobs.

- Matches: `https://working-class-hero-mtl.vercel.app/montreal?view=matches`
- Resume status: `https://working-class-hero-mtl.vercel.app/settings/resume`

For an immediate result, direct Akshit to open Matches. Otherwise, no manual action is required.
